Datarefers to distinct pieces of information, usually formatted and stored in a way that is concordant with a specific purpose.
Data can exist in various forms: as numbers or text recorded on paper, as bits or bytes stored in electronic memory, or as facts living in a personâ€™s mind.
Since the advent of computer science in the mid-1900s, however, data most commonly refers to information that is transmitted or stored electronically.
